Ideas
===============

Make a settings manager GUI
Make a profile manager GUI
Make so that profile startup errors are shown in a GUI and disable running until fixed.
Have seperate Activity and System (status, warning, errors) logs
Have a way to pause logs from updating and then resume to allow scrolling
Support multiple calculated values via exec. Array in to exec, to numbered strings in action script.
Handle paused Factorio server accepting but not reply to RCON command. It will honor the command when the server is unpaused. So different between start test connection and event handling.
Add a more complete test GUI with options to select subscription types, donation currencies, etc.
Look at supporting Twitch PubSub directly so I can get the Channel Points. May also open up othe opportunities: https://github.com/twitchdev/pubsub-samples/tree/1638781c0c096c4be43493a86f2a75401256583b/python
